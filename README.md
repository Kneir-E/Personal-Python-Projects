# Personal-Python-Projects
These are some of my personal python mini projects that are probably not very useful to others. Use what you want.
While most of these have no comments, these are the projects that I think are the most like actual projects and not just me playing around with no actual goal.

Here's a list of the projects and what they do:
1. Capturing Radiance Simulator - This is a small Genshin Impact Wish Simulator with no UI. I just wanted to test the rates of the new "Capturing Radiance" Mechanic
2. Client_Server_Hash - A Socket Server and Client implementation that uses RSA encryption as well as SHA256 hashing function

Monty Hall Fake - My attempt at proving that Monty Hall Problem is fake but turns out it's 100% real. This taught me that the host's action being a guranteed reveal is what changes the odds

Numerical Methods - A Lagrange Method Application

RGB_Controller - An unfinished script that uses the pyserial library to comunicate with an arduino to control an rgb strip

TextToImage - A program that assigns a color to each character in a text then creates an image (using PIL) from a text File

Will probably add more in the future / update these projects to be better if I feel like it
